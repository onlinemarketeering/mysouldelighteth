								<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/eternal-perspective.jpg" alt="Squeeze Scripture" /></span>You know, God loves us. One of the ways he shows that love is by giving us the scriptures. An instruction manual for this life and the one to come. A way for us to understand His great plan and what we can do to return to Him. Elder Oaks said it best,”Our understanding of God’s plan and His doctrine gives us an eternal perspective.”   What better way to understanding His plan then studying the doctrines of the gospel!   Now that we have discussed the why, let’s discuss the how. </p>
								<p>I know prayer and personal revelation are the ways to get absolute truth, and to feel pure joy. However, we should first ponder to be able to receive. Here is a list of things that we can do to begin the journey of studying the doctrine:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><h2>Basic Doctrines of the Church</h2></li>
									<p>The church has put together 9 Basic Doctrines for Seminary and Institutes.  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/PD00010275_eng.pdf?lang=eng" target="_blank"><u>Download a copy</u></a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/youth/learn/guidebook/doctrinal?lang=eng" target="_blank"><u>go to the website or use the smartphone app</u></a> to view the 9 Basic Doctrines.  Read through them and get familiarized. </p>
									<li><h2>Scripture Mastery</h2></li>
									<p>Scripture Mastery verses are chosen because they discuss the basic doctrines of the church.  What better way to study the doctrine than verses that discuss it.  You can find the scripture mastery verses using their app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lds-scripture-mastery/id413341700?mt=8" target="_blank"><u>Apple</u></a>) (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lds.sm&hl=en" target="_blank"><u>Android</u></a>) or going to <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/new-testament-teacher-resource-manual/appendix/scripture-mastery-lists?lang=eng" target="_blank"><u>seminary.churchofjesuschrist.org</u></a></p>
									<li><h2>Scripture Squeeze</h2></li>
									<p>This is a technique that I learned while teaching Seminary.   It is like squeezing an orange.   You hold the half of an orange in your hand and  squeeze.   Then you reposition it and squeeze again.   Then you squeeze one more time just to make sure you got every ounce of juice.</p>
									<p>So, I create a document. I copy and paste the verse I would like to squeeze in a newly created document.   Print it, and squeeze.   Squeeze a verse you like to study or combine it with the scripture mastery verses since they cover the basic doctrine of the church.   I promise you will be able to get more out of those verses by squeezing. <a href="../landing/squeeze.html" target="_blank"><u>I have even created a template to copy and paste your verse with some questions on the bottom of the template to be able to dig a little deeper in the verse.</u></a></p>
									<li><h2>Go to the Temple, Take a concept and study it until the next time you go back to the temple.</h2></li>
									<p>This one is fun.  Okay all of them are fun, but this one takes research and a little more time.  Sometimes I would read sequentially (Front to Back), and I find verses that either back-up what was taught in the temple or that explain it in more depth.  It is like getting that “AHA!” moment!</p>
									<li><h2>Ponderize the Scriptures.</h2></li>
									<p>I have only done this recently since it was spoken of in the last General Conference.   I have to admit, it is a lot of fun!  I even squeeze the verse.  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/my-heart-pondereth-them-continually?lang=eng" target="_blank"><u>Here are the steps given to us by Devin G Durrant, First Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency:</u></a> " There are two simple steps: 
										<ol>
											<li>First, choose a verse of scripture each week and place it where you will see it every day.</li>
											<li>Second, read or think of the verse several times each day and ponder the meaning of its words and key phrases throughout the week."</li>
										</ol>
									</p> 
									<li><h2>Ask Yourself Questions, and Apply What You Learn.</h2></li>
									<p>This sounds simple, right?  It can be easy once you get the hang of it.  There are up to four levels of questioning when studying a block of scripture.</p>
									<p>First are the search questions. This is what we ask ourselves the who, what, how, where and why.  This step is like giving the context of the scripture before you can teach from that scripture.  Once we have familiarized ourselves with the scripture block or verse, we move to the second step.</p>
									<p>Second is to analyze for understanding. "Analyze" questions are asked after we have become familiar with the verses we are studying and have more than one possible answer.  Questions like "What does it mean… Why is that… how is it that… Why do you think… In your opinion… What is the difference… are the differences… How do you think… How does… What are some ways… What principle or doctrine is illustrated by… Using what we have learned, how can you explain…?”</p>
									<p>Third are questions to invite feelings and testimony. "Invite feelings and testimony" questions help us think about and understand gospel doctrines and principles that lead us to reflect on our own feelings and spiritual experiences.  Questions like "When have you felt… Think of a time in your life… How are you blessed by living… When have you seen others… How is your life different…?”  Sometimes these questions come naturally after we have asked ourselves analyzing questions.  Other times we truly have to ask for us to be able to feel.  Most important about these sets of questions, is that they truly invite the spirit into our lives.  It is a true reflection of how our Father has touched our lives. But…we don’t want to end here!</p>
									<p>Fourth are questions of application.  "Encourage Application" questions require students to look at their lives and what they might do to make their lives better.  Questions like "What changes do you need to make… What have you learned… What difference would if make if… What do you feel/think God wants… What does God...expect...desire… How would you teach a friend… How has that affected you life…. What do you now know…?”  This is the hardest step to remember.   We have those feel goods like when we listen to conference but don’t quite act after we listen.  DEVISE YOUR ACTION PLAN!!   Apply what you learn when you read the scriptures!!</p>
								</ol>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>These obviously are not the only ways to begin to study the doctrine of the gospel.  But hopefully it helps!   Also mix and mingle.  I love doing the ponderizing with the squeeze.  And while I squeeze, I start to ask the questions.  I also notice that not everyone does the same thing, maybe similar but in their own way.  So make it yours.</p> 
						<p>Either way, you will be able to have deeper understanding about the basic doctrines.  Once you start studying the basics, you will be able to also deepen your eternal perspective.  You will be able to look at others as God looks at them with the potential that they have.  Just like in one of the verses I ponderized,"Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.”  I know this to be true!</p>
